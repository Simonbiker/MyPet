                Before walking your dog check the tempture of the bavement.
                You can do this by placing the palm of your hand on the concrete.
                If you are unable to hold there then your dog should not be walking.

                        Make sure your dog has access to shade or cooler rooms. Pull down blinds or draw
                        curtains if necessary.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">As a cooling treat, you can give your dog a handful of frozen peas. You
                        can also add ice
                        to their water or freeze their favourite treat and give it as an ice-cream.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">If you want to walk your dog, try to do so in the early morning and
                        evenings. If you are
                        walking your dog on concrete, touch the concrete with your palm as a test. If it feels hot
                        or you can't keep you hand comfortably on the concrete for 5 seconds, it is too hot to walk
                        your dog with their sensitive pads.</li>

                    <li class="list-group-item">Never leave your dog in the car even with the windows open, this can
                        prove fatal if the
                        car overheats. This can happen in less than 5 minutes.</li>
